## 1. Branching and Merging

- **Branching**:  
  A branch is an independent line of development. You can create a branch to work on a new feature without affecting the main codebase.
  ```bash
  git branch feature-branch
  git checkout feature-branch
  ```
  Or:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-branch
  ```

- **Merging**:  
  Merging combines changes from one branch into another.
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git merge feature-branch
  ```
  If no conflicts, Git merges automatically; otherwise, you must resolve conflicts manually.
